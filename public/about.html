<h1>About us</h1>
<p>
  We met back in 2018 for dental ailment. We became friends and then best friends. We went on for many dinner dates. But later realised that we are wasting our money and need to save. Nikita used to cook something everytime Rohan came to meet her and if they are going somewhere to eat, Nikita used to make something for Rohan to eat on the way

  As time passed, Rohan had only one thing in his mind and that was to own a house. It was also a covid time, there were financial difficulties and market was going down. Rohan had some SIPs but they became half of the price invested. So they waited until everything became better. During second covid wave, both Nikita and Rohan got covid positve. They decided to tell their parents about their love and get married once they get recovered. Rohan took out his saving bought a small flat as per his budget in corlim. Nikita helped him in designing and decorating it.
